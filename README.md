# Community Detection: Kernighan-Lin (Bipartite)

Created Kernighan-Lin algorithm that, for now, only processes very simple graphs and prints intermediate results. Few examples are included. Will create manual later. Also update to more partitions is expected.

## Constraints:

* Only processes undirected graphs
* Not extensively tested on larger graphs
