# Community Detection: Kernighan-Lin (Bipartite)

Created Kernighan-Lin algorithm that, for now, only processes very simple graphs and prints intermediate results to be able to keep track with the algorithm. Few examples are included. Will create manual later. Also update to more partitions is expected.

## Constraints:

* Only processes undirected graphs
* Not extensively tested on larger graphs
